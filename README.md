# EfficientLogisticsETA

## Project Overview
Economies are better when logistics is efficient and affordable. This project, in partnership with insight2impact facility, aims to predict the estimated time of delivery (ETA) of orders, from the point of driver pickup to the point of arrival at the final destination. This solution will help Sendy enhance customer communication and improve the reliability of its service, leading to a better customer experience.

## Project Goals
- **Predict Delivery Times**: Develop a model to predict the ETA of orders.
