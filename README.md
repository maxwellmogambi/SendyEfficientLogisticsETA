Predicting Delivery Time for Sendy
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the delivery time from pickup to arrival for Sendy, a delivery service. Using a dataset containing information about delivery orders, we preprocess the data, engineer features, and build predictive models to estimate delivery times.


Introduction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model to predict the time from pickup to arrival for delivery orders. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Data
The data includes information about delivery orders, such as the order details, pickup and delivery locations, times, distances, and rider metrics. We also utilize additional rider metrics from a separate dataset.

Feature Engineering
We perform several feature engineering steps to improve model performance:

Handling missing values
Scaling numerical features
Encoding categorical variables
Extracting new features from existing ones
Model Training
We use several regression models to predict the delivery time, including:

Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
We perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the models.

Evaluation
The models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics. The best-performing model is selected based on the lowest MSE and highest R² score.

Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>


Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

Make Predictions:
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

Requirements
The project requires the following libraries:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
scikit-learn

To install the dependencies, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Results
The best model achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of X and an R² score of Y. The predictions are saved in the submission.csv file, which contains the order IDs and the predicted delivery times.
